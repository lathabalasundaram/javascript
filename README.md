Tabbed Panel Using JavaScript, CSS and HTML

First, We are creating a div block in which tabbed panel will be displayed,
Then, we are creating 'Tab Menu' by using Unordered list whose look is changed into tab style by CSS,
Then, we creating another div block (Blank content) inside the main tabbed panel div block where data will be displayed after clicking on any one tab, as a default it will display Null data (Means no content).
Then, we are creating three more div blocks just below the div block created in step 3 to store information which will be displayed after clicking an relative tab with the help of 'Id' attribute of this div block, These blocks are set to hidden by css and will be only visible after any event/trigger occurs to call them.
